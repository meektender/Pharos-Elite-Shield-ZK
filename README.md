# Pharos Elite Shield: ZK-Identity Lounge 🛡️

## 🏆 Milestone: 100th Contract Deployment
This project marks a major milestone: my **100th smart contract deployment** on the Pharos Atlantic Testnet. This reflects my commitment to the ecosystem and technical proficiency, currently ranked in the **Top 0.05%** of network participants.

## 🧬 Mathematical Foundation
The security of this lounge is powered by **Groth16 Zero-Knowledge Proofs (zk-SNARKs)**.
* **The Secret ($s$):** A private key known only to the user.
* **The Public Signal ($p$):** $p = s^2$.
* **The Proof:** The system verifies that the user knows $s$ such that the circuit constraints are met without the user ever revealing $s$.

## 🚀 System Architecture
* **The Shield (M3):** A Soulbound NFT (SBT) at `0x7E26EA0Ab4393b09e37d48458Bb75A2c10f99465`.
* **The Gatekeeper (M1):** A ZK-Verifier contract at `0x5D3334F9f2e1eF52326915cd3dA36d2EE9dc894d`.
* **The Interface (M2):** A custom Web3 dApp for real-time verification and badge minting.

## 🔗 On-Chain Verification
* **Verified Contract:** [View on Pharoscan](https://atlantic.pharosscan.xyz/address/0x7E26EA0Ab4393b09e37d48458Bb75A2c10f99465#code)
* **Status:** Fully Functional & Soulbound (Non-Transferable)
