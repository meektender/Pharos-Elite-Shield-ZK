# 🏛️ Mission 2: The ZK-Gatekeeper

## 🎯 Mission Objective
The goal of this mission was to bridge a Web3 wallet connection with a Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) computation. I have built "The Olympic Lounge," which uses SnarkJS logic to verify a user's identity privately.

## 🛠️ Implementation Details
- **Circuit:** Developed a `shield.circom` circuit to handle private membership verification.
- **Frontend:** Built a custom UI in HTML/CSS that triggers the ZK-Proof generation.
- **Current Stage:** This is a **Functional UI Prototype**. 
    - *Note:* The ZK-Proof is currently simulated to demonstrate the "Shielding" workflow. 
    - Full on-chain verification using the `.zkey` and Smart Contract is scheduled for the next mission.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Connect any MetaMask wallet.
2. Click "Generate ZK-Proof."
3. Wait for the "Shielded Identity" computation to complete to gain access.
